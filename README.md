# Real estate CRM.

# Still in development...

**CRM system for real estate.**

This system will help a real estate agency or individual agents manage clients,
facilities, transactions and tasks.

**Key CRM functions for real estate:**

- Customer management

      1. Maintaining a customer database with information about each customer, their real estate preferences and interaction history.


      2. Setting statuses for clients (for example, "Potential", "Active", "Closed transaction") and segmentation by interests or budget.

- Object management

      1. Storing information about the property, including photos, descriptions, price, location and status (for example, "For sale", "Leased").


      2. Implementation of sorting and filtering of objects (by price, type, size, location) for fast work with the necessary ads.

- Tracking transactions and interactions

      1. Create and track transaction records with the ability to add notes, statuses (for example, "In progress", "Contract signed") and reminders.


      2. Maintaining a history of communications with clients, logs of object views or calls. Chat between the customer and the seller.

- Sales and Agent Analytics panel

      1. Displaying metrics and charts on the number of closed transactions, popular objects and the effectiveness of agents.


      2. Monthly reports on successful and unsuccessful transactions to improve your sales strategy.

- Calendar of tasks and events

      1. Reminders for agents about meetings, site views and transaction completion dates.


      2. The ability to add tasks related to specific deals or customers with notifications and reminders.

- Access control by roles (Admin, Agent, Client)

      1. Secure access control, where administrators can view and manage all data, agents only see their transactions, and customers can view their requests and real estate information shown to them.

- Notifications and alerts

      1. Notifications about transaction statuses, deadlines and meetings with clients. Automatic emails or messages to customers about new facilities that match their preferences.
